This assignment will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of guiding principles in secure software design.

<h1> Assignment Details</h1>

Secure Software Design Principles are found in the Architecture and Design Pocket guide that was part of this week’s readings. In this document, table 1 provides guidance for enhancing the development Life Cycle to Produce Secure Software.

Using the table as a guide, conduct research on the general principles in order to expand the existing information with more specific examples and practices. You need to dig deep to understand beyond the surface to the point where you can provide specific implementation details where possible.

Provide discussion on 3 of the “General Principles” and 5 out of the 14 “Key Practices” benefits/examples.  You should expand upon what is in the table. (i.e. don’t use examples from table verbatim). Pick an assortment of Key Practices at least 1 from each General Principle. Your report should be well-organized and provide references for all resources used.

Deliverable

You should create a word or PDF document with your report on secure software design guiding principles. The document should be well-written and include references for all sources you used support your work. Be sure to include your name, date and course number on the document in the title page. Page numbers should be included on each page of the document.
